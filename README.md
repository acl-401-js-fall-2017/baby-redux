* Mr Hog's budget app
* Tracker for your budgets, yay.
        the server for this app is a proxy server, the repo can be found at:
        https://github.com/ABodey/budgetTrackerServer
        you will need to read the readme in the server to get it setup, basically a .env file and a mongodb
        This should run on port 3000 by default.
